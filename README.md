Features of this application

Add New Todos using an input field and button.

Drag & Drop todos between Pending and Completed.

Delete Todos from the list.

API Integration (though the backend does not actually save changes).

Styled UI with good-looking buttons and input fields.



NOTES:
I have only created two lanes because todo api has only two states, Completed and Not Completed  which is true and false.
